# AC6ModManager: A Modloader for ARMORED CORE VI

Lord forgive me I have no experience in Windows automation scripting. As much an opportunity for me to learn how to write `.bat` files as it is a chance to help out the budding community of modmakers for this game.

The script handles the downloading and File I/O required to play any of the following AC6 Mods:
- BINC Patch: A rebalance of the vanilla game aimed at improving competitive 3v3 gameplay (Created by TreasuredLight)
- VumsyPatch: A buff-focused rebalance of the vanilla game aimed at improving 1v1 pvp gameplay (Created by Vumsy)
- AC6 Aftermath: A large scale mod introducing an array of new weapons, frame parts, and environments (Created by TheMaskMaster)

My gratitude to [@Vswarte](https://github.com/vswarte) for his incredible work in developing the core tools and the OpenServer that enables the development of these mods.
